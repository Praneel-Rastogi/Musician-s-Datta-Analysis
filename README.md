# Musician's Data Analysis
Being a musician, I was fascinated to do this project as this combined two of my interests.<br/>
<br/>
In this project, I have taken two datasets i.e. Listenings.csv and Genre.csv. <br/>
Listening.csv contains stats about various users and what kind of music do they listen to and information about the music they listen to like:<br/>
1) Artist Name<br/>
2) Album Name<br/>
3) Song Name<br/>

I ran multiple Queries and found many exciting insights.<br/>
